## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars, echo=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)

blockDf <- read.csv(file = 'block_header.csv', sep = ";")

indexDiff <- diff(blockDf$BlockIndex)

issues <- indexDiff[indexDiff > 1]
length(issues)
head(issues)


timeDiff <- diff(blockDf$Time)
hist(timeDiff)

timeDiffIssues <- timeDiff[timeDiff < 0]
length(timeDiffIssues)
head(timeDiffIssues)


mine <- function ( blockInterval ){
return(-log( 1.0 - runif(1) ) * blockInterval * 1  / 1 )
}


miningData <- c()
for (i in 1:10000)
  miningData[i] <- mine(600)



hist(miningData)

```
